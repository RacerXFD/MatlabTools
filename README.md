Matlab Tools

My custom matlab scripts and classes.


Classes
--------------------------

### @UC
The UC class is for manipulating and tracking uncertainty through operator
overloading of basic Matlab scalars and arrays. For usage examples, see
UC_test.m.

You can assign names to UC objects `z = UC(15, 10, 'z')` and then their
contribution to derived uncertainties will be tracked automatically.


### @Fluid
